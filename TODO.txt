redo math structures
expand type database
iterator objects
tuple objects
generic objects
function objects are an absolute nightmare
low level object types would benefit greatly from optimization & custom implementations

add "draw" functions to drawable resources like texture and mesh
maybe unify "scene" and "servers" into "runtime"
